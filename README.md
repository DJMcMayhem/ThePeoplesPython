# The People's Python

Idea: Replace every [keyword](http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list) and [built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) in Python 3 with a [PPCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) username.

Still finishing [name assignments](https://github.com/HelkaHomba/ThePeoplesPython/blob/master/assignments.txt). Project not going anywhere...
