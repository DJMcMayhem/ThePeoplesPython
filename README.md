# The People's Python

Idea: Replace every [keyword](http://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list) and [built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) in Python 3 with a [PPCG](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) username.

Still finishing [name assignments](https://github.com/HelkaHomba/ThePeoplesPython/blob/master/assignments.txt). If you have any ideas, or you would like to have your name put on the list, ping [@DJMcMayhem](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/31716/) in [The Nineteenth Byte](chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte).
